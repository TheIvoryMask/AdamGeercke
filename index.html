        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Adam Geercke, and I've been studying web development for a few months now. I'm still getting the hang of Javascript, though I'm vastly more comfortable on CSS and html. I'm beginning to dip my toes into React, and am looking for any opensource projects to help me gain experience. To this point, my only projects are small apps built from online tutorials and the myriad of websites I've made that I hated. If you're seeing this one, it means I've either given up on designing something good, or I didn't completely hate it. You pick.</p>
        <p>I'm also an experienced writer, having written articles for a number of sites, my own blog, and even novels that have yet to be published. I'm familiar with SEO practices, and am more than happy to write stuff for any kind of topic.  I also dabble in photography, but as you'll see below, I'm still not, like, good at that yet.</p>

            <p>A blog post about photography in Nagano, Japan. I spent two years living there, and though I didn't explore everywhere I want to, I still saw quite a bit. That's my wife in the photo, say nice things, please.</p></a>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>These are things that I wrote. Some of them are good, the other ones are there too. I've been writing fantasy for almost 18 years, ignore that I'm not published. Happy to do editing/proofreading if you're freaky like that. Also comfortable doing SEO writing, or just like blogs or articles if you need. I can be professional, swear.</p>
